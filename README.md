Days is a versatile line-a-day journal and log.  

Reflect on your day, write a story one line at a time, create one solid goal for the following day 
Up to 300 characters daily to essentialize your thoughts.

No editing.  No deletes.  Post with conviction -- or just for fun.  

A blank line is logged if you havenâ€™t posted by 11:59pm each day.  

After 100 posts, entries are archived, giving you a clean slate to embark on another 100 Days.

Users create accounts, choose from two UI themes, turn e-mail notifications on/off, and post a daily post.

Java SpringMVC, some JavaScript/Bootstrap/CSS/HTML
